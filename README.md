FPGA Controlled Automated TV Screen-off System for Child Protection
📖 Project Overview

This project is designed to enhance child safety by automatically turning off the TV screen when a child gets too close to it. The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance between the child and the screen.

If the distance falls below a safe limit, the FPGA processes the data and immediately turns off the display.

Once the child moves away to a safe distance, the display is restored.

This smart solution helps reduce eye strain and protects children's vision by ensuring they watch TV from a healthy distance.

✨ Key Features

✅ FPGA-based system to monitor child presence and automatically control TV screen status.

✅ Protects children's eyes by enforcing safe viewing distance.

✅ Designed in Verilog HDL for modular, hardware-level, real-time control.

✅ Integrated Ultrasonic Sensor with VGA display control for seamless detection and response.

✅ Power-efficient and independent of Smart TV functionalities – works with any display type.

✅ Scalable design – can be extended with AI-based detection or mobile alerts.

✅ Encourages responsible technology use for healthier child development.

🛠 Components Used

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

Jumper Wires

USB Cable

VGA Cable

VGA Monitor

FPGA EDGE Artix-7 Board

Xilinx Vivado Software

⚙️ Working Principle

The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance between the child and the TV screen.

If the child comes closer than the predefined safe distance:

The FPGA processes the signal.

The VGA output is controlled, and the display turns OFF.

When the child moves back to a safe distance:

The FPGA automatically restores the display.

📌 Applications

🏠 Home entertainment systems for safe TV viewing.

🎓 Educational environments with large displays.

🏢 Public information displays for crowd safety management.

🚀 Future Scope

AI-based detection for enhanced accuracy.

Mobile alerts for parental monitoring.

Extension to other display systems beyond TVs.

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how FPGA technology, when integrated with simple sensors, can provide innovative and practical solutions for child protection. It ensures safe and responsible TV usage, promoting healthier vision and better child development.
